# spreadsheet

Java application for data entry using a tab-separated flat file.  Reads file when program runs and displays data according to tabs between individual entries.  Saves data to file via button and displays messages.

NEEDS A LOT OF WORK!!

Need to add a lot of functionality to the GUI, specify file to load from user perspective, add key bindings / shortcuts, and a lot more.  Maybe switch to a database instead of a flat file.

Written for Linux, has not been tested on Windows or Mac.  Must be compiled and run from command line.
